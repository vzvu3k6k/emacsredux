    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm extremely fond of rectangle editing (the ability to select a
rectangular region and apply editing commands only to it), but I've
always disliked the fact there was no way to visually highlight the
exact rectangle region you've currently selected. Let's delete some
text in a rectangular region (with <code>C-x r d</code>), so you can see where the
problem lies:</p>

<p>It's not immediately clear where the rectangle bounds are (it's clear
where the rectangle region starts, but it's not so clear where it
ends), which is a source of constant confusion for many people.</p>

<p>Emacs 24.4 finally fixed this with the introduction of
<code>rectangle-mark-mode</code> (bound by default to <code>C-x SPC</code>). Let's see it in
action:</p>

<p>Perfect!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago I wrote about
<a href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/11/01/highlight-matching-delimiters-with-smartparens/">highlighting matching delimiters with show-smartparens-mode</a>. In
Emacs 24.4, the built-in <code>show-paren-mode</code> is capable of highlighting
more complex paired delimiters as well (like <code>do/end</code> in Ruby for
instance). There is one limitation to <code>show-paren-mode</code> (compared to
<code>show-smartparens-mode</code>) - it requires that the major mode, that it's
used together with (e.g. <code>ruby-mode</code>), is implemented in terms of the
new(ish) SMIE (Simple Minded Indentation Engine). SMIE has been around
since 23.3, but hasn't seen much adoption until quite recently. Prior
to Emacs 24.4 very few built-in modes were using it (and just about no
third-party major modes). In Emacs 24.4, however, a lot of modes were
updated to use SMIE (like <code>ruby-mode</code>), so you'll be able to enjoy the
<code>show-paren-mode</code> improvement with them.</p>

<p>Here's a glimpse of the enhanced <code>show-paren-mode</code> in action:</p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/show-paren-mode.gif"></p>

<p>Long term, I still think that betting on <code>smartparens-mode</code> is a good idea, but if
you prefer to stick with built-in modes - <code>show-paren-mode</code> is now more capable than ever.</p>
