    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often minor modes don't respect standard keybinding conventions and use some user reserved keys (like <code>C-c a</code>). Occasionally two minor modes would have conflicting keybindings or a minor mode would keybindings conflicting with a major mode. I guess you can imagine similar problems. Dealing with them is fairly straight-forward - we have to either unbind or rebind the offending binding:</p>

<p>``` cl
;; remove keybinding
(define-key minor-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") nil)</p>

<p>;; change keybinding
(define-key minor-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") (kbd "C-c C-c"))
```</p>

<p>Generally speaking you can use <code>define-key</code> to alter the keymap of a major mode as well, but those are rarely offenders when it comes to picking appropriate keybindings for their keymaps.</p>

<p>Normally you'd want to invoke the above code right after the related minor (or major) mode is loaded:</p>

<p><code>cl
(eval-after-load "minor-mode"
  '(define-key minor-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") nil))
</code></p>

<p>I'm not sure if one can have a minor mode having different keymaps in different major modes. I can certainly imagine situations when this would be useful. If someone knows how this could be done - please, share this knowledge in the comments.</p>
